SCENE IV. A hall in the same.

Enter KENT, disguised

KENT

If but as well I other accents borrow,
That my speech can defuse, my good intent
May carry through itself to that full issue
For which I razed my likeness. Now, banishâ€™d Kent,
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned,
So may it come, thy master, who thou lovest,
Shall find thee full of labours.

Horns within. Enter KING LEAR Knights and
attendants

KING LEAR

Let me not dawdle for dinner; go get it ready.
How now! what art thou?

KENT

Some dude.

KING LEAR

What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?

KENT

I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve
him truly that will put me in trust: to love him
that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,
and says little; to fear judgment; and to fight when I
have to.
